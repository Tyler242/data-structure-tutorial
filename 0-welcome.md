# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to my Data Structures Tutorial! Data structures are an essential piece of a software engineer or computer scientists array of tools. What kind of data structure you use and how you use it can be the life or death of your progam. Use them wisely!

Here are a few data structures I will cover in this tutorial:

- [Queue](queue/1-topic.md)
- [Linked List](linked-list/2-topic.md)
- [Tree](tree/3-topic.md)

Included within each tutorial will be descriptions, examples, working code, and a problem for you to solve. Try to solve the problem before looking at the solution! Remember that your solution may be different than the one presented but you should always stive for understandability, maintability, and efficiency.
